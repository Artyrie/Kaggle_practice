Need more practice.<br>
I can know just how to use tf.<br>
It was difficult to 1st competitions.<br>


### Cassava Leaf Disease Classification
* <https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification><br>

It was shocking competitions.<br>
I needed more computing power and information.<br>
I couldn't use large model and don't have any skill for using tf except for modeling.<br>
finally, rank 2 just use tfhub.<br>


### Bristol-Myers Squibb â€“ Molecular Translation
* <https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation/overview><br>
* code Skeleton <https://www.kaggle.com/yasufuminakama/inchi-resnet-lstm-with-attention-starter><br>

I studied Encoder-Decoder, Auto-Encoder System through this living compoetition.<br>
I focused on studying connecting models.<br>
It was very difficult subject, and it took a lot of time and resources.<br>
But I think I got a lot out of it.<br>
I want to study more and try it later.<br>
